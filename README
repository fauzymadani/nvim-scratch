# Personal Nvim Configuration
=============================
this is my personal nvim config made from scratch. require nvim v0.10 >.

# Installation
==============
just clone the repo and place it in `~/.config/nvim`.
    git clone https://fauzymadani/nvim-scratch.git ~/.config/nvim/
    nvim
this config is made as simple as possible for my arch (btw) setup.
